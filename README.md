# COS30045-T1-Website
T1(a) Appliance Energy Consumption Website

# Data Story
The audience for this visualisation is everyday Australian consumers who are thinking about buying a television. These customers usually focus on brand and screen size, but they also care about energy bills and star ratings. Our goal is to help them quickly understand:
-Which TV types are most energy-efficient
-How screen size affects energy use
-Which models provide the best balance between size, brand, and efficiency
